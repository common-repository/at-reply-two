This plugin allows you to add @reply links to comments.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to add Twitter-like @reply links to comments. When clicked, those links insert the author name and a link to the comment you are replying to in the text.

In addition, the Dashboard allows you to click to expand the parent comment (with a handy word count for those prolific commenters).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I activated the plugin but I can't see the reply links. =

If you're not using threaded comments, there is no reply link. And you should get a warning.

= I can see the reply links but clicking them does nothing. =

Either you have disabled JavaScript in your browser or your WordPress theme is not using the default id for the comments textarea (which is `comment`).

= It shows the full parent comment on the dashboard =

You must be on IE8. There's a details shim for Firefox and IE9+, but I drew the line at supporting IE8. Sorry banks.
